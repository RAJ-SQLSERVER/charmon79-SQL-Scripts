# SQL-Scripts
This is a repository of useful database administration scripts I've written or collected over the years. Most of them are for Microsoft SQL Server as that is the platform I've worked with the most in my career, but recently I've been adding PostgreSQL stuff too.

Any scripts I didn't write myself are attributed to their original author in comments.
